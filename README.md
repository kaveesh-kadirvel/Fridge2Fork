# Spice Savor - Flask Project (Converted)

This project was autogenerated by ChatGPT to convert your uploaded frontend into a Flask-based Python web app.

## Quick start (local)
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

## What I did
- Unzipped your uploaded archive and copied any `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, and image files into `templates/` and `static/`.
- Created a basic Flask `app.py` with a sample API endpoint `/api/spices`.
- Created `requirements.txt` and this `README.md`.
- Zipped the resulting Flask project for download at `spice_savor_flask_project.zip`.

## Next steps you might want
- Wire up a database (SQLite/Postgres) and create models (use Flask-SQLAlchemy).
- Add user authentication (Flask-Login / Flask-Security).
- Convert any client-side fetch calls to hit the Flask API endpoints.
- Deploy to Heroku / Railway / Render / Fly.io.
